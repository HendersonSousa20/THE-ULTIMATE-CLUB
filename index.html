    <p><strong>Design thinking </strong> is a non-linear, iterative process that teams use to understand users, challenge assumptions, redefine problems and create innovative solutions to prototype and test. It is most useful to tackle ill-defined or unknown problems and involves five phases: Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype and Test.</p>

      <p><strong>Why Is Design Thinking so Important?</strong>
        “Design thinking is a human-centered approach to innovation that draws from the designer's toolkit to integrate the needs of people, the possibilities of technology, and the requirements for business success.”
        <br>
        <br>
        — Tim Brown, CEO of IDEO
        <br>
        <br>
        Design thinking fosters innovation. Companies must innovate to survive and remain competitive in a rapidly changing environment. In design thinking, cross-functional teams work together to understand user needs and create solutions that address those needs. Moreover, the design thinking process helps unearth creative solutions.

        Design teams use design thinking to tackle ill-defined/unknown problems (aka wicked problems). Alan Dix, Professor of Human-Computer Interaction, explains what wicked problems are in this video.
